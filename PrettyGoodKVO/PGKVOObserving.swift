/// Simply declare any class (pure Swift or NSObject) to be PGKVOObserving and use the `observe`
/// and `unobserve` functions to start observing NSObjects.

    /// - Note: Unobservation happens either automatically when the object deallocates or the observer manually ends
    /// observation. The observer can safely deallocate without unobserving, however the `PGKVOProxy` observer
    /// will continue observing the object until the first change after the `PGKVOObserving` object deallocates.

    /// - Important: Only observations reflecting actual changes of value will be reported. To receive all observation
    /// notifications, see `NSObject+PGKVO.swift`.

    /// - Warning: Not all ObjectiveC classes are KVO compliant. You must verify that the object you are attempting
    /// to observe supports KVO or you will face trouble ahead.
