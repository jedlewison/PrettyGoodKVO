/// Closure for handling PGKVO observations
/// - Parameters:
///     - observed: The object being observed
///     - observer: The observer (the `self` of the object that start observing)
///     - changes: The dictionary of KVO change notifications
///     - Note: In Objective-C, you may wish to cast observed to typeof(object) and observer to typeof(self).

/// Use these extensions to observe or unobserve objects from Objective-C or Swift.
/// When using Swift, you should generally use the `PGKVOObserving` protocol unless you need
/// access to the raw change dictionary, control over observation options, or are observing
/// Foundation collection types.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///     - object: The object to observe
    ///     - forKeyPath: The keyPath of the object to observe
    ///     - options: The KVO options to select
    ///     - closure: A block on which to handle changes.
    ///
    /// - Important: This method creates a proxy observer if one does not already exist. The proxy observer removes itself from
    ///   the observed object when the observed object deallocates or on the first change after all observers have removed
    ///   themselves, so you do not need to explicitly stop observation.
    ///
    /// - Warning: Not all ObjectiveC classes are KVO compliant. You must verify that the object you are attempting
    /// to observe supports KVO or you will face trouble ahead.
